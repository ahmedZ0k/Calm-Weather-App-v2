              <h1>What Is Climate Change?</h1>

            <p>
              Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and
              weather patterns. Such shifts can be natural, due to changes in
              the sun’s activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the
              1800s, human activities have been the main driver of climate
              change, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal,
              oil and gas. Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas
              emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth,
              trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures. The main
              greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon
              dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a
              car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and
              cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture,
              oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions.
              Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use
              are among the main sectors causing greenhouse gases.

              <h2>Humans are responsible for global warming</h2>
              <img src="./images/crisis2.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Climate scientists have showed that humans are responsible for
              virtually all global heating over the last 200 years. Human
              activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse
              gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at
              least the last two thousand years. The average temperature of the
              Earth’s surface is now about 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late
              1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any
              time in the last 100,000 years. The last decade (2011-2020) was
              the warmest on record, and each of the last four decades has been
              warmer than any previous decade since 1850. Many people think
              climate change mainly means warmer temperatures. But temperature
              rise is only the beginning of the story. Because the Earth is a
              system, where everything is connected, changes in one area can
              influence changes in all others. The consequences of climate
              change now include, among others, intense droughts, water
              scarcity, severe fires, rising sea levels, flooding, melting polar
              ice, catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity.

            <p>
              Climate change can affect our health, ability to grow food,
              housing, safety and work. Some of us are already more vulnerable
              to climate impacts, such as people living in small island nations
              and other developing countries. Conditions like sea-level rise and
              saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole
              communities have had to relocate, and protracted droughts are
              putting people at risk of famine. In the future, the number of
              “climate refugees” is expected to rise.

              <h2>Every increase in global warming matters</h2>
              <img src="./images/crisis4.jpg" alt="" />
            </div>
            <p>
              In a series of UN reports, thousands of scientists and government
              reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more
              than 1.5°C would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and
              maintain a livable climate. Yet policies currently in place point
              to a 2.8°C temperature rise by the end of the century. The
              emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the
              world and affect everyone, but some countries produce much more
              than others.The seven biggest emitters alone (China, the United
              States of America, India, the European Union, Indonesia, the
              Russian Federation, and Brazil) accounted for about half of all
              global greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. Everyone must take
              climate action, but people and countries creating more of the
              problem have a greater responsibility to act first.

              <h2>We face a huge challenge but already know many solutions</h2>

            <p>
              Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while
              improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have
              global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the
              Sustainable Development Goals, the UN Framework Convention on
              Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Three broad categories of
              action are: cutting emissions, adapting to climate impacts and
              financing required adjustments. Switching energy systems from
              fossil fuels to renewables like solar or wind will reduce the
              emissions driving climate change. But we have to act now. While a
              growing number of countries is committing to net zero emissions by
              2050, emissions must be cut in half by 2030 to keep warming below
              1.5°C. Achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal, oil
              and gas: over two-thirds of today’s proven reserves of fossil
              fuels need to be kept in the ground by 2050 in order to prevent
              catastrophic levels of climate change.

          <h2>We can pay the bill now, or pay dearly in the future</h2>
          <p>
            Climate action requires significant financial investments by
            governments and businesses. But climate inaction is vastly more
            expensive. One critical step is for industrialized countries to
            fulfil their commitment to provide $100 billion a year to developing
            countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies.
